# Overview

In this project, I was once again trying to develop my programming skills in a new enviornment. It's one thing to be able to program in one language, but an entirely new experience with the ability to program in multiple langauges. This time, I decided to program in Kotlin. The program that I wrote was created to add and multiply matricies together. I chose to do this becuase I want to further my ability to apply my math background to my programming skills.

# Development Environment

To create this program, I had to use a new programming interface, IntelliJ IDEA. I usually like to use VSC but this had better compatability. In this project, I worked with Kotlin. It's based on Java, but provides more functionality than base Java.

# Useful Websites

While I was programming this, I used these websites as my main tool for research and learning.

- [Kotlin Website](https://kotlinlang.org/)

# Future Work

In the future, I hope to improve on the following:

- Add an inverse matrix functionality
- Apply GUI rather than a text based operation
- Optimization
